I am an avid collector of quotes. Although I am well aware that I am not worthy enough to write quotes, I am still writing some quotes. These are the quotes-

>“If established theistic religions do not go extinct sooner or later then there is no hope for humanity. Religion is just arrogance towards science.”

>“If humans had a life span of a billion years everyone would have become atheists before they die.”

>“Atheism may not have a specified purpose for life. So those who lost faith have to find their own purpose for life. It may be hard to find what is the purpose, but believe me it is better than following some blind stupid path based on religions. Ultimately fix your purpose before it is too late to accomplish.”
