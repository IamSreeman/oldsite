Until last year this course was called MA 105, now they have cut down some portion due to time constraint and renamed it MA 109. The following link has the lecture slides of MA 105 of my division which might be useful.

You might have already received the booklet containing tutorial sheets, if you haven't [download it here](https://github.com/iamsreeman/LaTeX/raw/master/MA109/2020ma109tutorial.pdf).

>“In order to put his system into mathematical form at all, Newton had to devise the concept of differential quotients and propound the laws of motion in the form of total differential equations—perhaps <b>the greatest advance in thought that a single individual</b> was ever privileged to make.”
