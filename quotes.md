These are some of my favourite quotes.

>“**Desires** are the root cause of **sadness**.”

― [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha)(second of the 4 nobel truths mentioned in the [Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta))(You can read my views on religion [here](/blog/views-on-religion/))


>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

>“**Time** is what prevents everything from happening at once.”

― [John Archibald Wheeler
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler)

>“The distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

― [Albert Eienstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)


>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of **false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”

― [P.A.M Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac)(at the 1927 Solvay Conference)


>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.”

― [Steven Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg)

>“But he (Galileo) was not an idiot,... **Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom** — that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in time.”

>“If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?”

― [David Hilbert](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert)


>“If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”

― [Henri Poincaré](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9)



>“I was born not knowing and have had only a **little time** to change that here and there.”

― [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman)

>“The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds. The pessimist fears it is true.”

― [J. Robert Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer)

>“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of **confident religions**, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
>
>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a **fraction of a dot**.
>
>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
>
>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores ***our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot***, the only home we've ever known.”

― [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space

>“Sometimes life's too **uncertain** to have regrets”

― [Goku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku)(Cell Games Saga)


>“జీవితంలో భయం ఉండాలి, కాని జీవితమే భయం కాకూడదు.”
 ― [రజినీకాంత్ ](https://te.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B0%B0%E0%B0%9C%E0%B0%BF%E0%B0%A8%E0%B1%80%E0%B0%95%E0%B0%BE%E0%B0%82%E0%B0%A4%E0%B1%8D)(భాష కినేమాలో)

>^ *Translates to* “There should be fear in life, but whole life should not become fear.”
― [Rajinikanth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinikanth)(From Basha movie)
